# ⚙️SEManager
SEManager is a handy package that allows you to play sound effects without being aware of the AudioSource.
Once SEManager is installed in your project, it will be automatically generated when the game is run.

<details><summary>Sample code</summary><div>
Play of sound effects is done as follows.

``` AudioClipPlayer.cs
using UnityEngine;
Using Yamara.Audio;

public class AudioClipPlayer : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] AudioClip clip;

    private void Start()
    {
        SEManager.Play(clip);
    }
}
````
We also have an extension method to play AudioClip using SEManager, so you can also write.

``` AudioClipPlayer.cs
using UnityEngine;

public class AudioClipPlayer : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] AudioClip clip;

    private void Start()
    {
        Play();
    Play(); }
}
````

</div></details>

## 🧮 Function

|function name|description|
|-|-|
|Play(AudioClip se)<br>Play(SEClip se)|Play|
|Play(AudioSource audioSource, SEClip se)|Play with AudioSource specified|
|PlayDelayed(AudioClip se, float delay)<br>PlayDelayed(SEClip se, float delay)|Delayed playback|
|PlayDelayed(AudioSource audioSource, SEClip se, float delay)|Play delayed with AudioSource specified|

We have extension methods "SEManagerExtensions" for AudioClip and AudioSource. Of the above functions, you can handle the Play system functions with ease.

## 📝 Notes

You can change the maximum number of simultaneous plays from SEManager / Resources / SEManagerSettings.asset.
You can change the volume from SEManager / SEAudioMixer.mixer (for playback with AudioSource specified, specify SEAudioMixer for AudioMixer).
# 💿SEClip
SEClip is a ScriptableObject that can be used to make sound effects less monotonous. When played back with multiple AudioClips and a pitch blur range, the sound effect will sound with a random AudioClip and pitch. This allows for variation in the sound of bullets, footsteps, etc. Playback can be done on SEManager in the same way as with AudioClip.
